      <h2>Recipe Description</h2>

      <p>At its most basic, crème brûlée is a creamy, pudding-like, baked custard with a 
        brittle top of melted sugar that cracks when you gently tap it with a spoon. 
        <br>The custard is made with heavy cream, eggs, sugar, and vanilla.</br>
      </p>


      
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul> <li>1.5 cups heavy cream (360g)  </li>
           <li>4 large egg yolks  </li>
           <li> ¼ cup granulated sugar (55g) + more for the crispy coating </li>
           <li> Pinch of salt </li>
           <li> ½ vanilla bean pod, or 1 tsp vanilla </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Steps </h2>

      <ol> <li>Pre-heat oven to 300F (conventional), and put a few cups of water to boil. This will be used for the water bath</li>
           <li>Add the heavy cream and vanilla to a saucepan and stir. Place on the stove on low heat until the cream starts to simmer (not a full boil)</li>
           <li>Add egg yolks, sugar and salt to a bowl and whisk until the yolks break down</li>
           <li>Once the cream is simmering, slowly pour about a fourth of it into the egg yolk mixture while continuing to whisk. This will temper the eggs so they don't curdle. Then add the remaining cream and whisk gently until combined. Don't overmix or whisk too aggressively as that will add too many air bubbles in the mixture</li>
           <li>Pass the custard through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps</li>
           <li>Divide the mixture equally between 3 8oz Creme Brulee ramekins, filling almost to the top</li>
           <li>Place the ramekins inside a larger baking tray, and carefully add boiling water to the tray, avoiding the ramekins. I fill enough water so it goes halfway up the height of the ramekins</li>
           <li>Carefully lift the tray with the water and ramekins and place inside the oven</li>
           <li>Bake for ~30-40 minutes, until the creme brulees are set around the edges but still have a wobble in the middle when gently shaken</li>
           <li>Immediately transfer the ramekins to the fridge, and cool overnight (or at least for 4 hours)</li>
           <li>The next day, sprinkle a thin layer of granulated sugar on each ramekin, and use a blowtorch to caramelize the sugar. It should become a deep brown color. I find it best to hold the blowtorch at a 45 degree angle</li>
           <li>Serve & enjoy!</li>
